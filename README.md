# Multi-task Heterogeneous Network Learning for Therapeutic Synergy Score Predictions 

How to use it:

1. __Download our collected and compiled dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/11xEGdgZLXlcxUfjajbrA3eSgIMT0-evr/view?usp=sharing, and put it into your specified file folder as the original data folder. The original data folder is used to generate the model input for each independent repeat.__

1. Download all the files.
2. Unzip data.rar to the "data" folder.
3. Tune the hyper-parameters following the instruction in run_model_evaluation.py.
4. Run run_model_evaluation.py to get evaluation results.

Instead of the framework name in the manuscript (i.e., Muthene), we use HNEMA (Heterogeneous Network Embedding with Meta-path Aggregation) here to define the function.
